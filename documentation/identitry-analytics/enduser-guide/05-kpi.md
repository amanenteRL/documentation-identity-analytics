# Computed KPIs  

KPIs are automatically computed during the data loading process, thanks to the "Metadata" technical feature. These KPIs are then distributed in the different search and detail pages, and sometime used in analytics reports also.

## Risk ranking and risk analysis  
One of the key features of IAS/IAP is to provide risk assessment and risk ranking to help end-users to identify the most risky situations and mitigate risks.

Three pre-calculated KPIs have been made available at organisation, Identity and Account level:
- the total number of risks
- the maximum risk level
- the risk rank  

The combination of these three KPIs will help the end-user to have a good idea of risk level of each resource and allow comparison for a better prioritization. Note that these KPIs are computed during the data upload. 

### Risk Rank  
Risk scoring and risk ranking are based on the control results, it helps in identifying where the problems are located and how the problems evolve. To get the list of all the controls available in your project and used for the Risk calculation, please go to section [How to list all the available controls](#advanced-feature-how-to-list-all-the-available-controls-their-description-and-manage-their-execution) of this document. 

Risk scoring is based on an aggregated score of the entity discrepancies, ponderated by the controls risk levels.  
Based on the risk scoring, a risk ranking is automatically computed. The higher the worst (account ranked #1 is the MOST RISKY account of the company). Entities with the exact same risk score are ranked the same, this is the reason why the end-user can have ex aequo situations. For more details about how Risk rank is computed, please check out the "Identity Analytics Integration Guide", section: IAS/IAP UX principles > UI Content Principles > Risk scoring & Risk ranking.  

Ranking is very useful to reorder entries with a risk approach perspective. Risks are available both on the search pages and on the details pages.  

### Nb of risks and Max risk level  
The end-user can associate to the risk rank the Nb of risks related to the entity. This helps to understand the context.
As in the exemple below, the end-user can have more risks but with a lower severity for an entity (Jaime ROBERTSON), so that the risk rank will be higher than for others with more severes controls defects (Sophia FOX).

## Other computed KPIs  
Other KPIs are automatically computed during the load of data in order to faciliate the analysis and to provide metrics and trends regarding the entities. These KPIs are provided as a series of “extended attributes” of the entities. As those KPIs are part of the datamodel you can use them in the user interfaces (such as search pages) or in your custom reports or analytics.
