# Detail pages

All detail pages follow the same navigation logic.  

The detail pages presents a 360Â° view of the selected entity, information is available through a series of tabs. Identity Analytcs Services or Platform dynamically pre-compute the tabs content and automatically hide most of the tabs if they are empty/not relevant in the context. This greatly simplify the browsing but can be a little confusing at first. As a general rule, consider that if a tab is not present it is because its content is empty.  

IAS/IAP enforce the "security by design" principle, as a result, the end-user cannot evade from a detail page. If context information is needed, it will be presented as a dialog box. Dialog boxes can be nested if needed.  

Context information is available through hyperlinks located in the widgets (Table, Pivot table, Buttons, ...)  

Please note also that most of the components (Table and Pivot Table) are configurable in a way that the end-user can configure the columns that he wants to display as well as their order. He can also export the table/pivot table content in Excel format. Right click on the widget in order to do so. Please go to the [How to configure tables, columns and export data](#standard-tables) section to know more about table customization.   

## Detail pages main tabs

Here is the list of the main tabs available for each resource type:  

- **Details tab** (first tab) presents general information regarding the selected entity.  
- **Security Model tab** (second tab) is an optional tab, it presents the computed business activities as well as the theoretical access rights that this entity is having. For instance, access granted through a ticketing system or an IAM system. Comparing these "theoretical" rights with the real one in the target application will provide the overallocated rights. Business activities are the prefered way to perform SoD checks. As a result, if he wants to configure SoD check, he MUST load business activities.
- **Access tab** (third tab) is an optional tab, it presents the "real" access rights as correlated from the various data sources (basically, the access rights that RadiantOne Identity Analytics found for this entity on the loaded systems).  
- **Controls tab** (fourth tab) presents the list of all the control defects found for this entity.  
- **Analytics tab** (fifth tab) presents all the analytics available for this entity. Analytics can be simple reports as well as more elaborated management interfaces.  
- **Decision history** (last tab) is an optional tab, it presents all the decision taken for this entity such as access review decision or entity update made through IAS/IAP (account reconciliation, classification update, management information update, ...).
