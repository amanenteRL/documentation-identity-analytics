# Available Controls

IAP comes with more than 100 off-the-shelf controls. These controls identify problems related to:

* Data quality
* Security policy violation
* Compliance gaps such as access certification, and
* Discrepancies through peer group and predictive analysis.

These controls are part of the data model and are presented in each detail pane. They are also used to compute risk scores. You can use them in your own dashboards, reports, reviews and analytics. You can also search for errors through the search pages. (You will have to switch to "free search" and enable "show extended attributes" to do this.)

Here is an extract of the available controls in IAP. Please consult "Settings &rarr; System &rarr; Manage Controls Execution" for an updated list of the controls available in your instance.

* **Control ID:** `ACC_01`
* **Entity:** Account
* **Name:** Unused account
* **Description** Unused accounts are defined as accounts that have not been used for at least 90 days or those that have never been used at all.
* **Risk Level:** 1
* **Risk description:** Unused accounts are, by definition, no longer monitored by their respective owners. These accounts can be hacked and used by an insider to impersonate an individual while engaging in fraudulent activity. Accounts can be unused if the account owner is no longer using the service, if the account owner is a contractor who no longer works for the company, or if the account is a test/service account that is no longer being used.
* **Remediation:** Monitor the account's last login date. If the last login date is greater than 60 days (or if the account has never been used), notify the manager of the account owner to disable or delete it. The account owner's manager is in charge of enforcing the security policy within his scope of responsibility.
