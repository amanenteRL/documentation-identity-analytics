# Welcome to Identity Analytics guides

This document describes the basic principles of IAP (Identity Analytics Platform) interfaces and dashboards.

Starting with Identity Analytics version Braille, the solution comes with a dedicated web experience called IAP (Identity Analytics Platform). The Identity Analytics Platform replaces the former webportal of Brainwave GRC.  

The main difference is that IAP comes with a series of off-the-shelf analytics/reports/controls/... to provide more value to the end-users.

IAP is also in an active development phase at RadiantLogic, thus by deploying IAP, not only the end user will benefit from a lot of off-the-shelf value, but he will also benefit of regular updates/improvements.

## Manifesto

IAP has been built with a set of general principles in mind, please find them below:

- **FAST:** results within 5 seconds, metadata powered
- **EFFICIENT:** All answers 3 clicks away
- **CONSISTENT:** Same navigation & presentation logic
- **SIMPLE** yet **POWERFUL**: Intuitive UX, rich analytics
- **RICH:** All concepts are leveraged, details are accessible when needed
- **TEMPORAL:** All UI include temporal analysis
- **SECURITY BY DESIGN:** You cannot see more than what is needed based on the your management responsibilities
- **EXTENSIBLE:** Easy to extend through 'Tags'
